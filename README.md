# ICP Development Environment with Azle and React

This template gives you everything you need to build a full-stack Web3 application on the [Internet Computer](https://internetcomputer.org/).
It includes a frontend built with Vite and React, and a backend written in JS/TS (Azle).

## Get started with one click:
### Locally:

Make sure you have you have the latest version of Docker (e.g. >25) and VS Code installed and running, then click the button below

### In your browser:

In Gitpod

## üöÄ Develop

When the editor opened, run the following commands to deploy the smart contract and start a development server:

```sh
npm install # Install project dependencies
dfx start --clean # Start the local ICP node
dfx deploy # Deploy smart contract locally
```

The canister will be reachable under `http://bkyz2-fmaaa-aaaaa-qaaaq-cai.localhost:4943`.
Call the canister using e.g., `curl http://bkyz2-fmaaa-aaaaa-qaaaq-cai.localhost:4943/contacts` for HTTP endpoints and `dfx canister call backend <method>` for Candid endpoints.
The frontend will update automatically as you save changes. 
To redeploy the smart contract, run `dfx deploy`.

When ready, run `dfx deploy --ic` to deploy your application to the ICP mainnet.

## üí° Tips and Tricks

- When developing remotely, navigating to the canister's frontend in the browser will not work.
Use `curl` on the command line instead, or develop locally.

- Note that you might need to disable CORS in your browser to make backend calls from `localhost`.
For example, for Chrome, run `open -n -a /Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome --args --user-data-dir="/tmp/chrome_dev_test" --disable-web-security`
 to disable CORS.

- If you get an error "Error: An error happened during communication with the replica: ... Connection refused", run `dfx start --clean` to start dfx.

## Description: 
This repo is a summary of our first bite of ICP, we extend the functionalities of the template such as a Canister that could keep track of its balance etc.

## Track: Fully on-chain dapps
## Team participants:

## Feedback:
## What you learned...
ICP's advantages that could make full-apps on chain, even the storage!
## Challenges...
Not familiar with JS Language(and the devops setup is kind of a torture), A tight timeline to really #finish# Something, 
## What you are proud of...
Gained a deeper understanding of ICP and learned/practiced a new tech stack.
